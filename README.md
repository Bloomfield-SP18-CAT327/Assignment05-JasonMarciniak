## UFO Game
### Premise
A simple game where the player controlls a UFO. The goal of the game is to loop around the track three times as fast as possible. If hit anything but the ramp, your ship is blown up and you are respawned at the last checkpoint (this will cost you time).

### Controls 
* Up/Down:    move foward/backwards
* Left/Right: trun left/right
